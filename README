The Jabber::Connection package provides basic functions
for connecting clients and components to a Jabber server. 

The package contains three modules:

- Jabber::Connection

  Handles connectivity, authentication, XML streaming and
  callbacks

- Jabber::NodeFactory

  Enables creation and manipulation of Jabber packets
  represented by Jabber::NodeFactory::Node objects

  Node: The latest version (0.04) of Jabber::NodeFactory::Node
  requires Scalar::Util for a function to weaken a parent/child
  pointer so circular references (and lack of garbage collection)
  can be avoided.

- Jabber::NS

  A heap of constants representing the Jabber namespace
  values and other things

It's a young package, all comments, questions and so on to
