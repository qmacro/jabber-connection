The Jabber::Connection package provides basic functions
for connecting clients and components to a Jabber server. 

The package contains three modules:

- Jabber::Connection

  Handles connectivity, authentication, XML streaming and
  callbacks

- Jabber::NodeFactory

  Enables creation and manipulation of Jabber packets
  represented by Jabber::NodeFactory::Node objects

- Jabber::NS

  A heap of constants representing the Jabber namespace
  values and other things

It's *still* a young package, all comments, questions and so
